What do the following functions do: Math.floor, Math.ceil, Math.trunc, Math.round?
- Floor: rounds down to nearest integer, Ceil: rounds up, Trunc: removes decimals, Round: rounds up or down depending on argument

When do Math.floor and Math.trunc not return the same value?

What is the % operator? When is it useful?
- returns the remainder (modulo)

How do I make variables declared outside (right next to) a function visible inside it?
