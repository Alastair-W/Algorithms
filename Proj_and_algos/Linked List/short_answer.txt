What is an object?
- an instance of a class

 How is an object different than an associative array?
 - They are the same?

 Are local variables allocated in the memory heap or the call stack?
 - memory heap

 What is this so-called call stack, anyway?
 - A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions
 
 And what is this memory heap. When do we use it?
 - The heap is a memory used by programming languages to store global variables. 
 
 What is the difference between a class and an object?
 - a class is the blueprint that is used to create the object
 
 What is an object constructor?
 - A function to create instance of the class

 What code is needed to create new object instances?
 - ?
 
 What is a pointer? Is this the same thing as the index of an array?
 - There is no functional difference, they both provide a reference to an item in memory 
 
 What is null? What would typeof tell us, if given null?
 - false
 
 What is a Singly Linked List (SList)?
 - a data structure where each element holds two components, a value and the next item in the list
 
 Generally, what are the attributes within a singly linked list?
 - It has a value and a pointer to the next item in list
 
 Why is it called a Singly Linked List?
 - because it only has one pointer (DLL has previous and next)

 Under what circumstances is an SList a better choice than an array?
 - You don't need concurrent memory available for the whole list making it more efficient to store the list
 
 What would typeof tell us, if given an SList?
 - object

 What is a Singly Linked List Node (SLNode)?
 - It is the container that holds the value and the pointer to the next item in list

 What are attributes of a singly linked list node? Do SLNodes always have only two attributes?
 - No, there could be more than two but no less (pointer and then as many values as you want)

 How would you determine whether an SList is empty?
 - if there is no head node
 
 What would typeof tell us, if given an SLNode?
 - object

 Are SList and SLNode objects built into JavaScript?
 - No

 What are the differences between a DList and an SList?
 - See above

 What are the differences between an SLNode and a DLNode?
 - See above
 
 Why might we use a DList instead of an SList?
 - for a lot of querying (performance)

 In JavaScript, what is the difference between alert() and prompt() and console.log()?
 - prompt requests input, alert pushes a message to the browser
 
 Personally, what do you do to make your code more understandable? Why do you do this?
 - intuitive naming of variables and comments
