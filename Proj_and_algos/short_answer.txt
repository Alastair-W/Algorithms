What is source code?
- text instructions that are then compiled into machine code for computers to execute the desired tasks

What makes computers so “smart”, anyway?
- they are able to consistantly and repeatedly perform a wide range of computations at a fraction of the time it takes humans

What is the purpose of a programming language?
- a human readable way of sending instructions to the computer via a compiler

What are 3 examples of programming languages? Why are there so many of these?
- Javascript, HTML, Python

What is a variable? Why are variables useful?
- it is a reference to an object that can store information and is useful to create more 'stateful' code

What is the difference between a single-equals (=) and a double-equals (==)?
- single: you are declaring a value, double: you are checking that the values are the same

What is the difference between a double-equals (==) and a triple-equals (===)?
- triple: you are checking that the data type is also the same

Why does the developer console exist?
- to monitor what is being executed for debugging and general observability

When we talk about “conditional” statements, what does that mean? What is an example?
- a condtional statement means there is some logic that needs to be followed in order for the code to execute. A For loop and If statement are conditional.

Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code?
- FOR loop is when you know how many times the statement needs to be run, WHILE is when you know the condition that needs to be met but have no visibility into how many times it will need to run

When would you use a WHILE loop, instead of a FOR loop?
- FOR loop: count all integers in a list. WHILE loop: add 'string' data types to a list but stop when the data type is an 'integer'

What is a function? Why would we use functions?
- a function is a set of code that takes a variable input and returns an output that is calculated based on that input and as a result can be resued

How many values can you receive back from a function? How many values can you send in?
- unlimited on both

What is an array? How many values does it hold?
- it's a data structure that holds a 'flat' list of unlimited values

What is a T-diagram and why should I know how to use one?
- it's maps out the variables in a block of code/function and tracks how the value of that variable changes as the code is run

What are the two ways to comment JS code? When would you use one versus the other?
- // is one way /* */ is another
